Crimewatch
=====

#### In our surveillance society, advancement of technologies have allowed various digital techniques to be used as tools for evidence-based legislation. is has prompted major shifts in the information technology landscape to focus on tools for solving crimes and preparing court cases. Police body-worn cameras, a relatively new tool for collecting digital evidence, have been found to decrease the likelihood of use-of-force and citizensâ€™ complaints against the police. On a related note, the portability and convenience of smartphones have allowed them to become powerful tools for creating, storing, and accessing digital evidence in the form of photos and videos. is evidence is extensively relied on for important information about both victims and suspects, and currently, there is no central tool for communities to use to collect this information. Crimewatch allows the general public to gather and assemble information and evidence about incidences anywhere.

#### In our surveillance society, advancement of technologies have allowed vario
us digital techniques to be used as tools for evidence-based legislation. is has
 prompted major shifts in the information technology landscape to focus on tools
 for solving crimes and preparing court cases. Police body-worn cameras, a relat
ively new tool for collecting digital evidence, have been found to decrease the 
likelihood of use-of-force and citizensâ€™ complaints against the police. On a rel
ated note, the portability and convenience of smartphones have allowed them to b
ecome powerful tools for creating, storing, and accessing digital evidence in th
e form of photos and videos. is evidence is extensively relied on for important 
information about both victims and suspects, and currently, there is no central 
tool for communities to use to collect this information. Crimewatch allows the g
eneral public to gather and assemble information and evidence about incidences a
nywhere.
